# VigilEye
this project is a traffic signal detection system for ADAS that identifies complex signal states, priority signals, local variations, and incorporates context-awareness for enhanced decision-making in real-time driving conditions.

To access our project-

There are 3 folders 
1. for phone detection
2. for looking in the sides
3. for traffic signals

1. For phone detection just run the html file and you will see a camera that will detect your phone if you place it near your ear.
2. for looking in the sides do the same as in the 1st case and look in the sides for more than 5 sec to get an alert. 
[for both of these files to work smoothly you should have a empty background ]
3. use some common traffic signals like stop speed limit and rest do the same.
4. {dataset used in this case is small }
